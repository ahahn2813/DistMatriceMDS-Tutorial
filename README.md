# DistMatriceMDS-Tutorial
Implementation and visualization of distance matrices and multidimensional scaling (MDS) using SciPy and scikit-learn to explore structure in high-dimensional data.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how distance matrices and multidimensional scaling (MDS) can be used to explore structure in high-dimensional datasets. It emphasizes both implementation and interpretation.

## Motivation
Distance-based methods provide a powerful geometric lens for exploratory data analysis. This project focuses on:
* Constructing and comparing distance metrics
* Visualizing embeddings
* Understanding distortion and limitations

## Installation
`pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib`

## Usage
* Compute distance matrices using multiple metrics
* Apply classical and metric MDS
* Visualize low-dimensional embeddings

## Materials
This repo includes a PDF of slides which provide an indepth explanation of distance matrices and MDS. The Jupyter Notebook provides examples and highlights utilizing scipy and scikit-learn to complete and analyze MDS.

## Tools
* Python
* SciPy
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
